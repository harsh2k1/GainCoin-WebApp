# CoinGain Web app

CoinGain is a digital platform where users can easily let go of their time constraints, risk, and knowledge factor and start investing easily. Once you link your bank account with CoinGain and successfully complete the KYC, CoinGain will automatically detect your payments and will round off the payment, and will automatically transfer a cryptocurrency of the user's choice to their wallet. The rounded-off difference can be as low as Rs 1 and the user will get a cryptocurrency worth that amount. This will cut the hassle of devoting time to picking up coins. Once the investment reaches a particular amount, the funds can be transferred to the user's bank account.
